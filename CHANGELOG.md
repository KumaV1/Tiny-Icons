#### Features
* Updated Mod API (officially re-instating it)

### [3.1.0] (2025-10-02)

#### Features
* Added translation support
  * Added German translation
* Scopes that were previously unable to show an icon should now do so
  * The behaviour is that the media of first reference of said scope will (e.g. a Fletching bonus for "Arrows" will display a Bronze Arrow)

#### Note

Technically, skills added by mods could still lead to a scope without icon (mod support for this will be implemented in the future). That being said, expansions to existing structures added via mods (e.g. a new category of items in Fletching) should already be picked up.
